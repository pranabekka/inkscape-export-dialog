Export Dialog Design for Inkscape

Suggestion for export dialog design following discussion on Martin Owens' Inkscape development log<<vlog>> on YouTube.

Reasoning: File formats determine export settings.
For example, when exporting a PDF file you might want to have mutliple pages in a single file,
but when you're exporting a PNG you likely want each area to be exported to a separate file.
